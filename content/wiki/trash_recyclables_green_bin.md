Trash is removed on Tuesday morning, usually at around 8.

Recyclables (in the blue bin) and the Green Bin are removed Friday morning, usually between 7:30 and 8. The Green Bin is for compostables, including leaf and lawn clippings, food waste, and cardboard pizza boxes. Information about what may be recycled is available on [Howard County's website](https://www.howardcountymd.gov/Departments/Public-Works/Bureau-Of-Environmental-Services/Recycling).

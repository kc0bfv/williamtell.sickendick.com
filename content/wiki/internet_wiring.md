There's an Ethernet cable entering the house from the garage, into the fireplace cabinet closest to the garage. It's a great place to put your cable modem. It's not the best place to put a wireless access point though, because it's a long way from some of the bedrooms. If you have a separate access point, you can put it in the cabinet above the refrigerator, plugging it into the Ethernet cable there. The other end of that cable is in the fireplace cabinet, coming up from the floor, so plug that into your modem/router.

Make sure the flue is open.  Reach up in there and feel for the handle, then push it back until it's fully open.

Here's a good depiction about how to light a fire in the fireplace: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2KodMIlk4w

I recommend actually using "fatwood fire starter" as the fire starter, instead of small sticks and newspaper.  The stuff is cheap, natural, and easy to find at the hardware store.

There's wood down under the deck you can use.  If it runs out, order some more!

The metal plate at the top front of the fireplace helps avoid smoke coming into the house.  This has been a problem for us...  Cracking a window, or the sliding doors sometimes helps, and building a smaller fire at the very back of the fireplace is also helpful.  Still, some smoke would sneak out at the top of the fireplace, as if the firebox wasn't tall enough with enough space for smoke to gather before going out the flue.  The metal plate makes that top deeper, so hopefully it'll work for you.

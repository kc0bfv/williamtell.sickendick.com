## Main Water Shutoff
Water shutoff is in the basement.  When you go down the stairs into the basement, there's a vertical pipe in the wall directly in front of you.  This is the main water input to the house.  Here are some photos of it turned on, and turned off.

## Front Exterior Water Shutoff
In the front of the house there's a water spigot, with the line running through the garage.  If the garage gets cold enough, this can freeze and break.  In the winter you should turn this off and drain it, then when the weather gets warmer you can turn it back on.  Some photos of the position and on/off are below.  To drain it:

1. Turn the line off (see the photo below). 
2. Open the outdoor, front spigot, to release any pressure in the line.  Leave it open.
3. Hold a bucket under the line handle, then unscrew and open the small round cover just underneath the handle.  That will let the water drain out.
4. Close that cover again, make sure to get the rubber seal in there.
5. When turning the water back on in the Spring, close the outdoor spigot first...

## Electric Shutoff
This is located in the garage, diagonally across from the door to the house, right up next to the garage doors.

1. Turn on the front hose when needed - see the [front spigot shutoff info here](/wiki/water_and_electricity_shutoff/)
2. Setup the humidifier
    1. Turn the humidifier's water off, all the way

    3. You can just leave the humidifier control set where it was.
3. Consider changing which vents are blowing - cool air falls, so maybe open some upstairs, close some downstairs?
4. Close the fireplace flue if you used the fireplace and plan to stop.

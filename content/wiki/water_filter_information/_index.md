The house has a reverse osmosis water filter! This is great because the water tastes great already, and this thing makes it taste even better. The filter is in the basement next to the A/C. It's a 5 stage TGI-525.

Its water comes out the spigot next to the kitchen sink, and out of the refrigerator. Don't drink the water from the refrigerator - it tastes bad for some reason. The ice from the refrigerator tastes fantastic. Use the ice, use the spigot next to the sink, feel refreshed.

If the water pressure from the sink spigot drops, it's time to replace the reverse osmosis filters. In 3 years we have not had this problem. If it's time, email Karl and he'll send you filters and walk through replacing them with you. He actually replaced them right before moving out, so they should be good for years.

Here's the filter, you've probably noticed it down there.

This depicts where you might have to tighten some of the filter hoses. Sometimes these spots drip water on the ground. These are just pressure fit hoses, so sometimes pulling on them gently, pushing gently, twisting a little, that'll stop the dripping.

This lawn never required much... Cut it every week or two, as needed. I never watered it. When the leaves fall, don't let them sit on the ground too long. I generally just mowed over them, mulching them. At some point in the year there will be too many leaves to leave on the ground, even mulched. Then, I mulched them, bagged that, then poured the bags around the flower beds as mulch for them.

Worked great - very cheap and easy.

1. Shut off front hose - see the [front spigot shutoff info here](/wiki/water_and_electricity_shutoff/)
2. Setup the humidifier
    1. Turn the humidifier's water on, all the way

    2. Change the airflow to the humidifier to direct air through it

    3. The humidifier should generally run now, in the winter, whenever the heater is running. If not, you can twist the control to the right. It's located just-behind the water filter.

3. Consider changing which vents are blowing - hot air rises, so maybe close some upstairs, open more downstairs?
